However there is no accurate published calculation of the proportion of the ca 352 000 species of angiosperms that interact with pollinators. Widely cited figures range from 67% to 96% but these have not been based on firm data. We estimated the number and proportion of flowering plants that are pollinated by animals using published and unpublished community-level surveys of plant pollination systems that recorded whether each species present was pollinated by animals or wind. The proportion of animal-pollinated species rises from a mean of 78% in temperate-zone communities to 94% in tropical communities. By correcting for the latitudinal diversity trend in flowering plants, we estimate the global number and proportion of animal pollinated angiosperms as 308 006, which is 87.5% of the estimated species-level diversity of flowering plants. Given current concerns about the decline in pollinators and the possible resulting impacts on both natural communities and agricultural crops, such estimates are vital to both ecologists and policy makers. Further research is required to assess in detail the absolute dependency of these plants on their pollinators, and how this varies with latitude and community type, but there is no doubt that plant-pollinator interactions play a significant role in maintaining the functional integrity of most terrestrial ecosystems. \textcopyright 2011 The Authors.

We examine the potential consequences of climate change on the geographical distribution of five native bee species and estimate the possible effects of bee distribution shifts on tomato crops in Brazil. Ensemble forecasting was implemented through five algorithms in two carbon emission scenarios to predict range shifts for five tomato-visiting bee species for the year 2100. We then calculated the total tomato crop area in the cells with at least 50% bee suitability, for each bee species, in each scenario. Results showed that all species will undergo a reduction in suitable areas in both scenarios. Bombus morio had the greatest area reduction in 2100 under the optimistic and pessimistic scenarios: near 38% and 71%, respectively. Centris tarsata had the smaller area reduction under the same scenarios: 8.5% and 19.5% respectively. The high agreement between tomato crops and bee distribution observed in the present will also be reduced in both scenarios for all species, especially in the pessimistic scenario. B. morio had the highest reduction in range due to habitat suitability and will be restricted to some parts of southeastern and southern Brazil. Over 60% of the tomato crop area presently within the distribution of B. morio will become climatically unsuitable in the pessimistic emission scenario. This study indicates that the predicted climate change may negatively impact several species associated with tomato crops in Brazil by the year 2100. This is troubling, as it could result in tomato production losses, which would bring economic and environmental losses to the tomato-producing regions with implications for pollinator conservation.","Ecosystem services,Modeling,Pollinator,Scopus,Solanum lycopersicum,Species conservation",,

Given regional differences in climate change, shifts in phenology will not be uniform across the globe, and conclusions drawn from temperate systems in the northern hemisphere might not be applicable to other regions on the planet. We conduct the largest meta-analysis to date of phenological drivers and trends among southern hemisphere species, assessing 1208 long-term datasets from 89 studies on 347 species. Data were mostly from Australasia (Australia and New Zealand), South America and the Antarctic/subantarctic, and focused primarily on plants and birds. This meta-analysis shows an advance in the timing of spring events (with a strong Australian data bias), although substantial differences in trends were apparent among taxonomic groups and regions. When only statistically significant trends were considered, 82% of terrestrial datasets and 42% of marine datasets demonstrated an advance in phenology. Temperature was most frequently identified as the primary driver of phenological changes; however, in many studies it was the only climate variable considered. When precipitation was examined, it often played a key role but, in contrast with temperature, the direction of phenological shifts in response to precipitation variation was difficult to predict a priori. We discuss how phenological information can inform the adaptive capacity of species, their resilience, and constraints on autonomous adaptation. We also highlight serious weaknesses in past and current data collection and analyses at large regional scales (with very few studies in the tropics or from Africa) and dramatic taxonomic biases. If accurate predictions regarding the general effects of climate change on the biology of organisms are to be made, data collection policies focussing on targeting data-deficient regions and taxa need to be financially and logistically supported. \textcopyright 2013 Chambers et al.",Scopus,,

Although much is known about how co-flowering affects pollination and plant reproduction, how these interactions are mediated by changes in abiotic conditions is unclear. Using a short-term field experiment based on a long-term flowering phenology dataset, we examine how changes in co-flowering between Linum lewisii and Potentilla pulcherrima affect the pollination and reproductive success of Linum in control and water addition scenarios. Linum is co-flowering less than it used to with Potentilla as the climate changes. We therefore removed Potentilla flowers to alter the degree of co-flowering from 0 to 100%; half of these plots received additional water to relieve drought stress. Linum plants experiencing less overlap with Potentilla had a higher proportion of conspecific pollen on their stigmas in both watered and unwatered plots. Plants experiencing less overlap also produced more seeds per plant, but only in the watering treatment. There was no evidence of pollen limitation of reproduction, but watered plants produced more seeds. These results show that plants that co-flowered to a lesser extent with Potentilla had enhanced reproductive output, probably because they received a higher proportion of Linum pollen, but these biotic effects were only detectable when the plants were less water-limited. This study provides empirical evidence that climate-driven changes in co-flowering can alter reproduction via competition for pollination, and that these biotic effects can be mediated by abiotic conditions.","Competition for pollination,Drought,Heterospecific pollen transfer,Phenology,Plant-climate interactions,Scopus,Synchrony",,

Climate change can disrupt this synchrony as phenological responses to climate vary within and across species. However, intra- and interspecific variation in phenological responses is seldom considered simultaneously, limiting our understanding of climate change impacts on interactions among taxa across their ranges. We investigated how variation in phenological sensitivity to climate can alter ecological interactions simultaneously within and among species using natural history collections and citizen science data. We focus on a unique system, comprising a wide-ranged spring ephemeral with varying color morphs (Claytonia virginica) and its specialist bee pollinator (Andrena erigeniae). We found strongly opposing trends in the phenological sensitivities of plants vs their pollinators. Flowering phenology was more sensitive to temperature in warmer regions, whereas bee phenology was more responsive in colder regions. Phenological sensitivity varied across flower color morphs. Temporal synchrony between flowering and pollinator activity was predicted to change heterogeneously across the species' ranges in the future. Our work demonstrates the complexity and fragility of ecological interactions in time and the necessity of incorporating variation in phenological responses across multiple axes to understand how such interactions will change in the future.","Scopus,Virginia spring beauty,ecoregion,flowering,occurrence,phenological mismatch,spring beauty miner bee",,

Pollination by insects, an ecosystem service of immense economic and conservation importance [2], depends on synchrony between insect activity and flowering time. If plants and their pollinators show different phenological responses to climate warming, pollination could fail. Information about the effects of warming on specific plant-insect mutualisms is difficult to obtain from complex pollination networks [3]. In contrast, the extraordinarily specific deceptions evolved by orchids [4] that attract a very narrow range of pollinators allow direct examination of the potential for climatic warming to disrupt synchrony. Here we show that a sexually deceptive orchid and the solitary bee on which it depends for pollination will diverge in phenology with increasing spring temperature. Male bees inadvertently pollinate the orchid flowers during pseudocopulation. Analysis of museum specimens (1893-2007) and recent field-based records (1975-2009) showed that flight date of the solitary bee Andrena nigroaenea is advanced more by higher temperatures than is flowering date in the deceptive orchid Ophrys sphegodes. Male bees emerged slightly earlier than females, which attract male copulatory attentions away from the deceptive flowers. Warming by as little as 2°C increased both the probability of male flight and the proportion of females flying in the bee population before orchid flowering; this would reduce the frequency of pseudocopulation and thus lower pollination success rate in the orchid. Our results demonstrate a significant potential for coevolved plant-pollinator relationships to be disrupted by climatic warming.",Scopus,,

This spatial variation is critical for determining whether subpopulations and metacommunities are changing in unison or diverging in phenology. Divergent responses could reduce synchrony both within species (disrupting gene flow among subpopulations) and among species (disrupting interspecific interactions in communities). We also lack understanding of phenological change in environments where life history events are frequently aseasonal, such as the tropical, arid, and semi-arid ecosystems that cover vast areas. Using a 33-year-long dataset spanning a 1,267-m semi-arid elevational gradient in the southwestern United States, we test whether flowering phenology diverged among subpopulations within species and among five communities comprising 590 species. Applying circular statistics to test for changes in year-round flowering, we show flowering has become earlier for all communities except at the highest elevations. However, flowering times shifted at different rates across elevations likely because of elevation-specific changes in temperature and precipitation, indicating diverging phenologies of neighboring communities. Subpopulations of individual species also diverged at mid-elevation but converged in phenology at high elevation. These changes in flowering phenology among communities and subpopulations are undetectable when data are pooled across the gradient. Furthermore, we show that nonlinear changes in flowering times over the 33-year record are obscured by traditional calculations of long-term trends. These findings reveal greater spatiotemporal complexity in phenological responses than previously recognized and indicate climate is driving phenological reshuffling across local spatial gradients. Using 33 years of data, Rafferty et al. test whether flowering times have diverged for neighboring communities comprising 590 species across an elevational gradient. Divergent and nonlinear shifts in flowering time are related to elevation-specific changes in temperature and precipitation and will likely alter species interactions and gene flow.","Scopus,circular statistics,communities,metacommunities,plant-pollinator interactions,plasticity,precipitation,semi-arid ecosystems,subpopulations,temperature",,

A review,Agronomy for Sustainable Development,2009,29,3,409-421,,,2009,,1774-0746,http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/agro:2008066,10.1051/agro:2008066,,"Ecosystems have an essential role in providing services to humankind such as nutrient cycling, pest control, pollination, quality of life, and hydrological, atmospheric and climatic regulation. About 60% of the world's known ecosystems are currently used unsustainably. In Europe, the richness and abundance of biodiversity is undergoing significant decline, partly due to climate change. This article outlines the impacts of climate change on biodiversity by showing both observed and projected changes in the distribution and phenology of plants and animals (phenology refers to changes in the timing of seasonal events). The four major findings are the following. (1) Concerning the distribution of plant species, climate change is responsible for the observed northward and uphill distribution shifts of many European plant species. By the late 21st century, distributions of European plant species are projected to have shifted several hundred kilometres to the north, forests are likely to have contracted in the south and expanded in the north, and 60% of mountain plant species may face extinction. The rate of change will exceed the ability of many species to adapt. (2) Concerning plant phenology, the timing of seasonal events in plants is changing across Europe due to changes in climate conditions. For instance, 78% of leaf unfolding and flowering records show advancing trends. Between 1971 and 2000, the average advance of spring and summer was 2.5 days per decade. The pollen season starts on average 10 days earlier and is longer than 50 years ago. Trends in seasonal events will continue to advance as climate warming increases in the years and decades to come. (3) Concerning the distribution of animal species, Europe's birds, insects, and mammals are moving northwards and uphill in response to observed climate change. Rate of climate change, habitat fragmentation and other obstacles will impede the movement of many animal species. Distribution changes are projected to continue. Suitable climatic conditions for Europe's breeding birds are projected to shift nearly 550 km northeast by the end of the century. Projections for 120 native European mammals suggest that up to 9% face extinction during the 21st century. (4) Concerning animal phenology, climatic warming has caused advancement in the life cycles of many animal groups, including frogs spawning, birds nesting and the arrival of migrant birds and butterflies. Seasonal advancement is particularly strong and rapid in the Arctic. Breeding seasons are lengthening, allowing extra generations of temperature-sensitive insects such as butterflies, dragonflies and pest species to be produced during the year. These trends are projected to continue as climate warming increases in the decades to come. Populations may explode if the young are not exposed to normal predation pressures. Conversely, populations may crash if the emergence of vulnerable young is not in synchrony with their main food source or if shorter hibernation times lead to declines in body condition. \textcopyright 2009 INRA EDP Sciences.","Amphibian,Animal,Biodiversity,Bird,Butterfly,Climate change,Insect,Leafing date,Phenology,Plant,Pollen season,Reptile,Scopus,Temperature",,

Yet productivity may be reduced if environmental conditions reduce floral synchrony or if plants within a field do not overlap sufficiently in flowering periods. We experimentally manipulated water availability and measured its effect on flowering, including the anthesis-silking interval (ASI) and crop yield components in open-pollinated (OP) and hybrid corn cultivars. Although watering treatments did not affect traits, we detected cultivar-specific phenological and yield responses. Hybrid plants were earlier to silk than OP plants, which tasseled for longer, had a longer ASI, and lower yield components. The less diverse hybrids also expressed less variation in ASI. We suspect other methods for reducing moisture in the field, including earlier moisture removal, might have better elicited a biological response in maize. Nevertheless, because shorter ASI is genetically correlated with increased drought tolerance, we predict this hybrid may be more resilient than the OP under more extreme drought scenarios. Consideration for how genetic diversity found in OP varieties and crop landraces may respond to variation in moisture availability apparent with climate change may be warranted.","Anthesis-silking interval,Corn,Drought tolerance,Reproductive development,Scopus,Yield loss",,

Flowering phenology can mediate plant reproductive success in several ways, including pollinator interactions, flowering synchrony with conspecifics, and timing of suitable abiotic conditions. We explored factors that control phenology and reproductive success for an alpine cushion plant, Silene acaulis, across two years and four sites, totaling 1,123 plants, in Colorado, USA. We investigated relationships between flowering time, flowering synchrony, and reproductive success with local abiotic conditions and pollinator behavior. Mean flowering phenology was strongly correlated with the timing of snowmelt across sites and years. Relative to mean flowering times, earlier flowering plants generally produced more flowers and experienced greater soil moisture during flowering but reduced synchrony with conspecifics. Fruit set tended to increase with greater soil moisture, synchrony during flowering, and earlier flowering times. Pollinator visitation increased with local Silene flower density. Earlier snowmelt and drier conditions later in the season favor earlier flowering, but these effects are partially counteracted by the positive effects of synchrony, perhaps because of changes in pollinator visitation. Overall, while both biotic and abiotic effects influence reproductive success, late-season drought may outweigh the benefits of flowering synchrony to increasingly favor earlier flowering.","Phenology,Scopus,Silene acaulis,climate change,flowering synchrony,pollination",,

Previously adapted varieties may be poorly prepared for these changing conditions, if such conditions induce mismatched phenologies. Crops that depend on cross-pollination and synchronous flowering may be most susceptible, e.g. monoecious plants have separate male and female flowers, and changes in flowering synchrony may alter yield. Using genetically diverse (open-pollinated (OP)) and genetically homogeneous (hybrid) varieties of a monoecious crop, courgette, also known as zuchinni (Cucurbita pepo), phenological responses to experimentally manipulated moisture conditions were explored in an agricultural context. Under drier and wetter conditions, the hybrid courgette plants shifted towards a male-biased floral sex ratio due to the reduced production of female flowers. However, flowering synchrony and fruit production were unaffected by moisture treatment in both varieties. The hybrid and OP varieties differed in many traits related to floral sex ratios, phenology, synchrony and fruit production. Further, the OP variety displayed more phenotypic variation than the hybrid in many traits. Being in a population context rather than relying on self-pollination increased the availability of potential mates for a given female flower in both the hybrid and, particularly, the OP variety. Thus, the increased genetic diversity found in OP v. hybrid varieties may buffer the possible environmental effects on flowering synchrony within a cropping context. Finally, the likelihood of female flowers setting fruit increased with the number of male flowers within a population, and the rate of increase was higher in the hybrid variety. In summary, climate change is predicted to reduce investment in female function in some monoecious crops and genetically diverse varieties may play an important role in maintaining reproductive synchrony in altered environments. \textcopyright Cambridge University Press 2012.",Scopus,,

Methods Geographic ranges of 12 South African bee species representing dominant distribution types were studied, and the climate change impacts upon bees were examined with A2 and B2 climate scenarios of HadCM3 model, using MaxEnt for species distribution modelling. Results The predicted levels of climate change-induced impacts on species ranges varied from little shifts and range expansion of 5-50% for two species to substantial range contractions between 32% and 99% in another six species. Four species show considerable range shifts. Bees of the winter rainfall area in the west of South Africa generally have smaller range sizes than in the summer rainfall area and generally show eastward range contractions toward the dry interior. Bee species prevalent in summer rainfall regions show a tendency for a south-easterly shift in geographic range. Main conclusions The bee fauna of the CFR is identified as the most vulnerable to climate change due to the high level of endemism, the small range sizes and the island-like isolation of the Mediterranean-type climate region at the SW tip of Africa. For monitoring climate change impact on bees, we suggest to establish observatories in the coastal plains of the west coast that are predicted to be worst affected and areas where persistence of populations is most likely. Likely impacts of climate change on life history traits of bees (phenology, sociality, bee-host plant synchronization) are discussed but require further investigation. \textcopyright 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Bees,Climate sensitivity,Future climate scenario,Geographic range shift,Pollination,Scopus,South Africa",,

Climate-change driven shifts in plant phenology may disrupt plant–plant and plant–pollinator interactions, resulting in reshuffling of communities and altered ecosystem processes. We present a unique long-term metacommunity-wide study relating changes in flowering synchrony within and among species along an elevational gradient to changes in local climatic conditions. We apply a circular statistical method that estimates flowering phenology overlap between entire flowering distributions, overcoming limitations and biases of single indicators such as first and last flowering dates. We analyzed more than 300 000 flowering overlap estimates between 217 species in five plant communities across a 1267 m gradient over four decades (1984–2019) in the southwestern USA. We show that co-flowering synchrony significantly decreased in all plant communities, with a maximum of 28.1% of synchrony lost at the lowest elevations. Decreased synchrony was significantly negatively correlated with increasing temperatures recorded across the gradient. Reduced precipitation had locally-dependent effects and, in combination with warmer temperatures, accelerated the decrease in synchrony, especially at the lowest elevations. Flowering synchrony within plant species occurring in multiple communities increased between most community pairs, with a maximum increase of 30.5%, and at accelerated rates in recent years. The exception, likely associated with differences in topography, was a 5.6% decrease in synchrony between the two highest-elevation communities. Overall, increased synchrony within species occurring at multiple elevations indicates homogenization of flowering phenology across the gradient. These results show significant reshaping of flowering synchrony within and between plant communities in response to changing climate. Because plant phenology influences many ecological processes, such fundamental changes may have far-reaching and negative effects on ecosystem stability.","2022 the authors,Scopus,climate change,ecography published by john,ecosystems,flowering phenology,metacommunity,mountain,of nordic society,pollination,sons ltd on behalf,wiley",,

Shifts in plant phenology can trigger consequences for the plants themselves as well as the communities of consumers that depend upon them. We assembled historical observations of first-flowering dates for 51 species collected in the 1970s and 1980s in a montane sagebrush community in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem and compared these to contemporary phenological observations targeting the same species and locations (2016–2019). We also assembled regional climate data (average spring temperature, day of spring snowmelt, and growing degree days) and tested the relationship between first-flowering time and these variables for each species. We observed the largest change in phenology in early-spring flowers, which, as a group, bloomed on average 17 days earlier, and as much as 36 days earlier, in the contemporary data set. Mid-summer flowers bloomed on average 10 days earlier, nonnative species 15 days earlier, and berry-producing shrubs 5 days earlier, while late summer flowering plants did not shift. The greatest correlates of early-spring and mid-summer flowering were average spring temperature and day of snowmelt, which was 21 days earlier, on average, in 2016–2019 relative to the 1973–1978 observations. The shifts in flowering phenology that we observed could indicate developing asynchronies or novel synchronies of these plant resources and wildlife species of conservation concern, including Greater Sage-grouse, whose nesting success is tied to availability of spring forbs; grizzly bears, which rely heavily on berries for their fall diet; and pollinators. This underscores the importance of maintaining a diverse portfolio of native plants in terms of species composition, genetics, phenological responsiveness to climatic cues, and ecological importance to key wildlife and pollinator species. Redundancy within ecological niches may also be important considering that species roles in the community may shift as climate change affects them differently. These considerations are particularly relevant to restoration and habitat-enhancement projects in sagebrush communities across western North America.","Grand Teton National Park,Greater Sage-grouse,Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem,Scopus,climate change,community ecology,flowering time,phenological mismatch,phenology,restoration,snowmelt timing,spring temperature",,

Despite concerns that plants and pollinators might be at risk of such decoupling, there have been few attempts to test this hypothesis using detailed phenological data on insect emergence and flowering at the same localities. In particular, there are few data sets on pollinator flight seasons that are independent of flowering phenology, because pollinators are typically collected at flowers. To address this problem, we established standardized nesting habitat (trap nests) for solitary bees and wasps at sites along an elevational gradient in the Rocky Mountains, and monitored emergence during three growing seasons. We also recorded air temperatures and flowering phenology at each site. Using a reciprocal transplant experiment with nesting bees, we confirmed that local environmental conditions are the primary determinants of emergence phenology. We were then able to develop phenology models to describe timing of pollinator emergence or flowering, across all sites and years, as a function of accumulated degree-days. Although phenology of both plants and insects is well described by thermal models, the best models for insects suggest generally higher threshold temperatures for development or diapause termination than those required for plants. In addition, degreeday requirements for most species, both plants and insects, were lower in locations with longer winters, indicating either a chilling or vernalization requirement that is more completely fulfilled at colder sites, or a critical photoperiod before which degree-day accumulation does not contribute to development. Overall, these results suggest that phenology of plants and trap-nesting bees and wasps is regulated in similar ways by temperature, but that plants are more likely than insects to advance phenology in response to springtime warming. We discuss the implications of these results for plants and pollinators, and suggest that phenological decoupling alone is unlikely to threaten population persistence for most species in our study area. \textcopyright 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.","Climate change,Elevational gradient,Hymenoptera,Phenology,Pollination,Reciprocal transplant experiment,Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory,Scopus,Solitary bees,Trap nests,Trophic mismatch",,

To explore this possibility, we compared dates of first arrival of Broad-tailed Hummingbirds (Selasphorus platycercus) to dates of flowering of plants they visit for nectar. Near the southern limit of the breeding range, neither hummingbird arrival nor first flowering dates have changed significantly over the past few decades. At a nearby migration stopover site, first flowering of a major food plant has advanced, but peak flowering has not. Near the northern limit of the breeding range, first and peak flowering of early-season food plants have shifted to earlier dates, resulting in a shorter interval between appearance of first hummingbirds and first flowers. If phenological shifts continue at current rates, hummingbirds will eventually arrive at northern breeding grounds after flowering begins, which could reduce their nesting success. These results support the prediction that migratory species may experience the greatest phenological mismatches at the poleward limits of their migration. A novel hypothesis based on these results posits that the poleward limit for some species may contract toward lower latitudes under continued warming.","Scopus,broad-tailed hummingbird,climate change,colorado,ecological interactions,flowering time,laboratory,latitude,migration,phenological shifts,pollination,reproductive success,rocky mountain biological,selasphorus platycercus,synchrony,usa",,

We studied masting in the valley oak (Quercus lobata Née), a California endemic tree, and report evidence that phenological synchrony in flowering driven by microclimatic variability determines the size of the acorn crop through its effects on pollen availability and fertilization success. These findings integrate two of the major factors believed to influence seed production in wind-pollinated species-environmental conditions and pollen limitation-by means of a coherent mechanistic hypothesis for how highly variable and synchronized annual seed production is accomplished. We illustrate how, by means of a simulation based on the mechanism proposed here, climate change may influence masting patterns through its effects on environmental variability.","Hastings Natural History Reservation, coastal California, USA,Mast fruiting,Masting,Phenological synchrony,Phenology,Pollen limitation,Quercus lobata,Scopus,Valley oak",,

Much like spatial community reassembly, temporal reassembly could be particularly important when critical species interactions are temporally concentrated (e.g., plant-pollinator dynamics during flowering). Previous studies have documented species-specific shifts in phenology driven by climate change, implying that temporal reassembly, a process we term “phenological reassembly,” is likely. However, few studies have documented changes in the temporal co-occurrence of community members driven by environmental change, likely because few datasets of entire communities exist. We addressed this gap by quantifying the relationship between flowering phenology and climate for 48 co-occurring subalpine wildflower species at Mount Rainier (Washington, USA) in a large network of plots distributed across Mt. Rainier's steep environmental gradients; large spatio-temporal variability in climate over the 6 yr of our study (including the earliest and latest snowmelt year on record) provided robust estimates of climate-phenology relationships for individual species. We used these relationships to examine changes to community co-flowering composition driven by ‘climate change analog' conditions experienced at our sites in 2015. We found that both the timing and duration of flowering of focal species was strongly sensitive to multiple climatic factors (snowmelt, temperature, and soil moisture). Some consistent responses emerged, including earlier snowmelt and warmer growing seasons driving flowering phenology earlier for all focal species. However, variation among species in their phenological sensitivities to these climate drivers was large enough that phenological reassembly occurred in the climate change analog conditions of 2015. An unexpected driver of phenological reassembly was fine-scale variation in the direction and magnitude of climatic change, causing phenological reassembly to be most apparent early and late in the season and in topographic locations where snow duration was shortest (i.e., at low elevations and on ridges in the landscape). Because phenological reassembly may have implications for many types of ecological interactions, failing to monitor community-level repercussions of species-specific phenological shifts could underestimate climate change impacts.","Scopus,climate change,community shifts,disassembly,elevation gradient,global change,mutualisms,phenological synchrony",,

Notably, temporal synchrony shapes the patterns of interactions by influencing the probability of encounters between interacting partners; thus, species phenology greatly contributes to structuring ecological communities. In these communities, specialized species are expected to show a high level of synchrony with their partners; however, the relationship between species phenology and specialization remains largely unexplored. In three localities in the tropical mountains of Costa Rica, we quantified the level of phenological synchrony in plant–pollinator networks and tested whether phenological synchrony is associated with the degree of pollinator specialization on plant partners. We also tested the relationship between pollinator specialization and the length of the flowering phase of the visited plants. Across all three studied networks, our results show a strong asynchrony between interacting plant and pollinator species. We also found that more specialized pollinators were more asynchronous with their plant partners and, moreover, that specialized pollinators preferably visited plant species with shorter flowering phases compared to generalized pollinators. These patterns suggest that specialized pollinators may be more vulnerable to mutualistic disruptions because they depend primarily on short-lived resources and have a high risk of phenological mismatch. This discovery has important consequences for specialized species' potential to survive and adapt to changes in the phenology of their interacting partners, which is highly relevant in a time characterized by changing climates and associated shifts in species phenology.","Scopus,mutualistic interactions,phenological synchrony,pollination,pollinator vulnerability,specialization,temporal asynchrony",,

We simulated current and future combinations of temperature and photoperiod to assess effects on the overwintering and spring phenology of an early flowering plant species (Crocus sieberi) and the Western honey bee (Apis mellifera). We could show that increased mean temperatures in winter and early spring advanced the flowering phenology of C. sieberi and intensified brood rearing activity of A. mellifera but did not advance their brood rearing activity. Flowering phenology of C. sieberi also relied on photoperiod, while brood rearing activity of A. mellifera did not. The results confirm that increases in temperature can induce changes in phenological responses and suggest that photoperiod can also play a critical role in these responses, with currently unknown consequences for real-world ecosystems in a warming climate.","Apis mellifera,Crocus sieberi,Scopus,climate change,phenology,plant–pollinator interaction,temporal mismatch",,

In this study we reviewed the evidence for phenotypic selection acting on flowering phenology using ordinary and phylogenetic meta-analysis. Phenotypic selection exists when a phenotypic trait co-varies with fitness; therefore, we looked for studies reporting an association between two components of flowering phenology (flowering time or flowering synchrony) with fitness. Data sets comprising 87 and 18 plant species were then used to assess the incidence and strength of phenotypic selection on flowering time and flowering synchrony, respectively. The influence of dependence on pollinators, the duration of the reproductive event, latitude and plant longevity as moderators of selection were also explored. Our results suggest that selection favours early flowering plants, but the strength of selection is influenced by latitude, with selection being stronger in temperate environments. However, there is no consistent pattern of selection on flowering synchrony. Our study demonstrates that phenotypic selection on flowering time is consistent and relatively strong, in contrast to previous hypotheses of selective neutrality, and has implications for the evolution of temperate floras under global climate change. \textcopyright 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.","Flowering phenology,Flowering synchrony,Flowering time,Mutualisms,Natural selection,Phenotypic selection,Scopus",,

We combine 46 years of data on apple flowering phenology with historical records of bee pollinators over the same period. When the key apple pollinators are considered altogether, we found extensive synchrony between bee activity and apple peak bloom due to complementarity among bee species' activity periods, and also a stable trend over time due to differential responses to warming climate among bee species.

As expected, given an increase in average air temperature with climate warming and a declining temperature with increasing elevation, there have been significant shifts toward higher elevation for queens or workers or both, for most bumble bee species, for bumble bee queens when species are combined, and for two focal plant species, with no significant downward shifts. However, contrary to our hypotheses, we failed to observe significant altitudinal changes for some bumble bee species and most plant species, and observed changes in elevation were often less than the upward shift of 317 m required to maintain average temperature. As expected, community flowering phenology shifted toward earlier in the season throughout our study area, but bumble bee phenology generally did not change, resulting in decreased synchrony between bees and plants. However, we were unable to confirm the narrower expectation that phenologies of bumble bee workers and community flowering coincided in 1974 but not in 2007. As expected, because of reduced synchrony between bumble bees and community flowering, bumble bee abundance was reduced in 2007 compared with 1974. Hence, climate change in our study area has apparently resulted primarily in reduced abundance and upward shift in distribution for bumble bees and shift toward earlier seasonality for plant flowering.

Here, we analyze for the first time baseline data for monitoring plant phenological dynamics and plant–pollinator networks along an elevation gradient between 4,200 and 4,600 m asl in three mountain summits of the Venezuelan Andes, which are part of the GLORIA monitoring network. We estimated the presence and density of plants with flowers in all the summits and in permanent plots, every month for 1 year. Additionally, we identified pollinators. We calculated a phenological overlap index between species. We summarized the plant–pollinator interactions as a bipartite matrix and represented a quantitative plant–pollinator network, calculating structural properties (grade, connectance, nestedness, and specialization). We also evaluated whether the overall network structure was influenced by differences in sampling effort, changes in species composition between summits, and phenology of the plant species. Finally, we characterized the pollination syndrome of all species. Flowering showed a marked seasonality, with a peak toward the end of the wet season. The overall phenological overlap index was low (0.32), suggesting little synchrony in flowering among species. Species richness of both plants and pollinators decreased along the elevation gradient. Flies, bumblebees, and hummingbirds were the most frequent pollinators in the network, while entomophily and anemophily were the prevailing pollination syndromes. The interaction network in all summits showed high connectance values, significant specialization (H2), and low nestedness. We did not find a significant effect of sampling effort, summit plant species composition, or plant phenology on network structure. Our results indicate that these high tropical alpine plant communities and their plant-pollination networks could be particularly vulnerable to the loss of species in climate change scenarios, given their low species richness and functional redundancy coupled with a high degree of specialization and endemism.",Scopus,,

Intraseasonal and habitat-specific variation in the impact of these factors was analysed by comparing predictions of time-to-event models using linear mixed-effects models. Temperature was the overwhelming trigger of flowering phenology for all species. Its synchronizing effect was strongest at or shortly after flowering indicating the particular importance of phenological control of pollination.

In all chapters connections are made from smaller to larger scales of ecological organization, providing a foundation for understanding plant ecology. Where relevant, environmental threats to ecological systems are identified and future research needs are discussed. As future generations take on the responsibility for managing ecosystem goods and services, one of the most effective resources that can be passed on is accumulated knowledge of how organisms, populations, species, communities and ecosystems function and interact across scales of organization.

Here, we examine associations between the abiotic environment and plant-pollinator phenological synchrony using a long-term syrphid fly-flowering phenology dataset (1992-2011). Degree-days above freezing, precipitation, and timing of snow melt were investigated as predictors of phenology. Syrphids generally emerge after flowering onset and end their activity before the end of flowering. Neither flowering nor syrphid phenology has changed significantly over our 20-year record, consistent with a lack of directional change in climate variables over the same time frame. Instead we document interannual variability in the abiotic environment and phenology. Timing of snow melt was the best predictor of flowering onset and syrphid emergence. Snow melt and degree-days were the best predictors of the end of flowering, whereas degree-days and precipitation best predicted the end of the syrphid period. Flowering advanced at a faster rate than syrphids in response to both advancing snow melt and increasing temperature. Different rates of phenological advancements resulted in more days of temporal overlap between the flower-syrphid community in years of early snow melt because of extended activity periods. Phenological synchrony at the community level is therefore likely to be maintained for some time, even under advancing snow melt conditions that are evident over longer term records at our site. These results show that interacting taxa may respond to different phenological cues and to the same cues at different rates but still maintain phenological synchrony over a range of abiotic conditions. However, our results also indicate that some individual plant species may overlap with the syrphid community for fewer days under continued climate change. This highlights the role of interannual variation in these flower-syrphid interactions and shows that species-level responses can differ from community-level responses in nonintuitive ways. \textcopyright 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Climate change,Hoverfly,Mismatch,Phenology,Pollinator,Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory,Scopus,Synchrony,Syrphidae",,

Changes in masting are often paralleled by warming temperatures, but the underlying proximate mechanisms are unknown. We used a unique 39-year study of 139 European beech (Fagus sylvatica) trees that experienced masting breakdown to track the seed developmental cycle and pinpoint phases where weather effects on seed production have changed over time. A cold followed by warm summer led to large coordinated flowering efforts among plants. However, trees failed to respond to the weather signal as summers warmed and the frequency of reproductive cues changed fivefold. Less synchronous flowering resulted in less efficient pollination that further decreased the synchrony of seed maturation. As global temperatures are expected to increase this century, perennial plants that fine-tune their reproductive schedules based on temperature cues may suffer regeneration failures.","Scopus,mast seeding,phenology,pollen limitation,proximate mechanisms,reproduction,seed production,synchrony,warming",,

A total of 12 risks were identified that could be classified as being related to either temperature, rainfall and evapotranspiration, or wind and hail. Some risks encompassed several weather factors. For example, the risk of rain at harvest (ranked as most important risk), is related to excessive moisture caused by rain and insufficient drying which is best approximated by evapotranspiration, which is itself a complex relationship between elements including incoming solar radiation, wind, temperature and humidity. Other risks such as synchronicity of flowering between pollinators are related to both varieties accumulating their respective chill and heat requirements to flower at similar times. Risks could also be categorised as being related to either single weather events (e.g., rain at harvest, frost or heatwave) or of a longer nature (e.g., insufficient chill or seasonal drought).

The high degree of variation in species' phenological shifts has raised concerns about the temporal decoupling of interspecific interactions, but the extent and implications of this effect are largely unknown. In the case of plant-pollinator systems, more specialized species are predicted to be particularly threatened by phenological decoupling, since they are assumed to be less flexible in the choice of interaction partners, but until now this hypothesis has not been tested. In this paper, we studied phenology and interactions of plant and pollinator communities along an altitudinal gradient in the Alps as a model for the possible effects of climate change in time. Our results show that even relatively specialized pollinators were much more flexible in their use of plant species as floral resources than their local flower visitation suggested. We found no relationship between local specialization of pollinators and the consistency of their visitation patterns across sites, and also no relationship between specialization and phenological synchrony of pollinators with particular plants. Thus, in contrast to the conclusions of a recent simulation study, our results suggest that most pollinator species included in this study are not threatened by phenological decoupling from specific flowering plants. However, the flexibility of many rarely observed pollinator species remains unknown. Moreover, our results suggest that specialized flower visitors select plant species based on certain floral traits such as the length of the nectar holder tube. If that is the case, the observed flexibility of plant-pollinator interactions likely depends on a high degree of functional redundancy in the plant community, which may not exist in less diverse systems. \textcopyright 2013 British Ecological Society.","Climate change,Ecological network,Elevation,Flowering,Mutualistic interaction,Phenological decoupling,Phenological mismatch,Phenological shift,Pollination,Scopus",,

One possible scenario is for insect phenology to advance more rapidly than plant phenology. However, empirical evidence for fitness consequences due to temporal mismatches is lacking for pollinators and it remains unknown if bees have developed strategies to mitigate fitness losses following temporal mismatches. We tested the effect of temporal mismatches on the fitness of three spring-emerging solitary bee species, including one pollen specialist. Using flight cages, we simulated (i) a perfect synchronization (from a bee perspective): bees and flowers occur simultaneously, (ii) a mismatch of 3 days and (iii) a mismatch of 6 days, with bees occurring earlier than flowers in the latter two cases. A mismatch of 6 days caused severe fitness losses in all three bee species, as few bees survived without flowers. Females showed strongly reduced activity and reproductive output compared to synchronized bees. Fitness consequences of a 3-day mismatch were species-specific. Both the early-spring species Osmia cornuta and the mid-spring species Osmia bicornis produced the same number of brood cells after a mismatch of 3 days as under perfect synchronization. However, O. cornuta decreased the number of female offspring, whereas O. bicornis spread the brood cells over fewer nests, which may increase offspring mortality, e.g. due to parasitoids. The late-spring specialist Osmia brevicornis produced fewer brood cells even after a mismatch of 3 days. Additionally, our results suggest that fitness losses after temporal mismatches are higher during warm than cold springs, as the naturally occurring temperature variability revealed that warm temperatures during starvation decreased the survival rate of O. bicornis. We conclude that short temporal mismatches can cause clear fitness losses in solitary bees. Although our results suggest that bees have evolved species-specific strategies to mitigate fitness losses after temporal mismatches, the bees were not able to completely compensate for impacts on their fitness after temporal mismatches with their food resources.","Scopus,conditional sex allocation,emergence,mitigation strategies,mutualism,phenological shift,pollination,species interactions",,

Relationships between reproductive phenology and components of fitness were studied for two years in the north-temperate, self-incompatible, insect-pollinated, and bird-dispersed shrub Frangula alnus (Rhamnaceae). Fruit set, dispersal, germination and juvenile survival, as well as seed mass and juvenile size were measured in relation to flowering, fruiting and germination time. The results suggest that effects of flowering and fruiting time prevailed in subsequent phases, to some extent as far as to the juvenile phase, but effects of timing were complex and had partly opposing effects on different fitness components. Early flowers had higher fruit-set and experiments indicated that synchronous peak flowering increased fruit-set, but later flowers had higher seed mass. Peak fruiting was not associated with peak dispersal. Late fruits derived from late flowers promoted dispersal. Juvenile recruitment was enhanced by increasing seed size. We conclude that the phenology of flowering and fruiting in F. alnus comprises several features, each with different and sometimes counteracting effects on fitness components.

However, even if flowering is brought forward in the season at higher elevations, an elevational temperature gap is likely to remain between the high-and low-elevation populations of a species at the time these reach peak flowering on account of the atmospheric reduction in temperature with increasing elevation. The negative effect of this temperature gap on pollination could be compensated by plastically-pro-longed flower life spans at higher elevations, increasing the probability of pollination. In a tightly temperature-controlled study, the flowering phenology adjustment and flower longevity compensation hypotheses were investigated in an alpine species in the Andes of central Chile. The snow free period varied from 7 to 8.2 months over 810 m elevation. Temperatures were suitable for growth on 82–98% of the snow free days. Flowering onset was temporally displaced at the rate of 4.6 d per 100 m increase in elevation and flowering was more synchronous at higher elevations. Flowering phenology was adjusted over elevation. The latter was manifest in thermal sums tending to decrease with elevation for population flowering onset, 50% flowering, and peak flowering when the lower thermal limit for growth (TBASE) was held constant over elevation. For TBASE graded over elevation so as to reflect the growing season temperature decline, thermal sums did not vary with elevation, opening the door to a possible elevational decline in the thermal temperature threshold for growth. Potential flower longevity was reduced by passive warming and was more prolonged in natural populations when temperatures were lower, indicating a plastic trait. Pollination rates, as evaluated with the Relative Pollination Rate index (RPR), when weighted for differences in floral abundance over the flowering season, declined with elevation as did fruit set. Contrary to expectation, the life-spans of flowers at higher elevations were not more prolonged and failed to compensate for the elevational decrease in pollination rates. Although strong evidence for phenological adjustment was forthcoming, flower longevity compensation did not occur over Oxalis squamata´s elevational range. Thus, flower longevity compensation is not applicable in all alpine species. Comparison with work conducted several decades ago on the same species in the same area provides valuable clues regarding the effects of climate change on flowering phenology and fitness in the central Chilean alpine where temperatures have been increasing and winter snow accumulation has been declining.","Alpine,Flower longevity,Flowering phenology,Growing season,Oxalis squamata,Relative Pollination Rate index,Scopus,South American Andes,TBASE,Thermal growth threshold",,

Snowmelt occurs earlier, but is decoupled from seasonal warming. Climate warming advances the timing of snowmelt and early season phenological events (e.g., the onset of greening and flowering); however, earlier snowmelt without warmer temperatures may have a different effect on phenology. Here, we report the results of a set of snowmelt manipulations in which radiation-absorbing fabric and the addition and removal of dust from the surface of the snowpack advanced or delayed snowmelt in the alpine tundra. These changes in the timing of snowmelt were superimposed on a system where the timing of snowmelt varies with topography and has been affected by increased dust loading. At the community level, phenology exhibited a threshold response to the timing of snowmelt. Greening and flowering were delayed before seasonal warming, after which there was a linear relationship between the date of snowmelt and the timing of phenological events. Consequently, the effects of earlier snowmelt on phenology differed in relation to topography, which resulted in increasing synchronicity in phenology across the alpine landscape with increasingly earlier snowmelt. The consequences of earlier snowmelt from increased dust deposition differ from climate warming and include delayed phenology, leading to synchronized growth and flowering across the landscape and the opportunity for altered species interactions, landscape-scale gene flow via pollination, and nutrient cycling.","Climate warming,Phenology,Plant life history,Scopus,Synchronization,Threshold",,

Inter-annual variability in flowering patterns may have important consequences for attractiveness to pollinators, and ultimately, plant reproductive output. To understand the consequences of flowering pattern variability, a community approach is necessary because pollinator flower choice is highly dependent on flower context. Our objectives were: 1) To quantify yearly variability in flower density and phenology; 2) To evaluate whether changes in flowering patterns result in significant changes in pollen/nectar composition. We monitored weekly flowering patterns in a Mediterranean scrubland community (23 species) over 8 years. Floral resource availability was estimated based on field measures of pollen and nectar production per flower. We analysed inter-annual variation in flowering phenology (duration and date of peak bloom) and flower production, and inter-annual and monthly variability in flower, pollen and nectar species composition. We also investigated potential phylogenetic effects on inter-annual variability of flowering patterns. We found dramatic variation in yearly flower production both at the species and community levels. There was also substantial variation in flowering phenology. Importantly, yearly fluctuations were far from synchronous across species, and resulted in significant changes in floral resources availability and composition at the community level. Changes were especially pronounced late in the season, at a time when flowers are scarce and pollinator visitation rates are particularly high.

When the synchrony of flowering and pollinator emergence is disturbed by climate change, seed production may be restricted due to insufficient pollination success. We revealed the mechanism of phenological mismatch between a spring ephemeral (Corydalis ambigua) and its pollinator (overwintered bumblebees), and its impact on plant reproduction, based on 19 years of monitoring and a snow removal experiment in a cool-temperate forest in northern Japan. Early snowmelt increased the risk of phenological mismatch under natural conditions. Seed production was limited by pollination success over the 3 years of the pollination experiment and decreased when flowering occurred prior to bee emergence. Similar trends were detected on modification of flowering phenology through snow removal. Following snowmelt, the length of the pre-flowering period strongly depended on the ambient surface temperature, ranging from 4 days (at greater than 78C) to 26 days (at 2.58C). Flowering onset was explained with an accumulated surface degree-day model. Bumblebees emerged when soil temperature reached 68C, which was predictable by an accumulated soil degree-day model, although foraging activity after emergence might depend on air temperature. These results indicate that phenological mismatch tends to occur when snow melts early but subsequent soil warming progresses slowly. Thus, modification of the snowmelt regime could be a major driver disturbing spring phenology in northern ecosystems.","Bombus,Global warming,Phenological mismatch,Pollinator,Scopus,Snowmelt,Spring ephemeral",,

In most years since 1993, I have monitored fruit set in temporal cohorts (early-to late-flowering groups of plants) at one site. To assess 'pollination limitation', I have also conducted supplemental hand-pollination experiments at various times through the blooming season. The onset of blooming is determined by snowmelt, with the earliest years starting a month before the latest years owing to variation in winter snowpack accumulation. Fruit set is diminished or prevented entirely by killing frosts in some years, most frequently but not exclusively for the earlier cohorts. When frosts do not limit fruit set, pollination limitation is frequent, especially in the earlier cohorts. Pollination limitation is strongest for middle cohorts: it tends to be negated by frost in early cohorts and ameliorated by continuing emergence of bumble-bee queens in later cohorts.

Across the years of the study, pollination limitation appears to be increasing, perhaps because the synchronization is getting worse. \textcopyright 2010 The Royal Society.","Bombus,Climate change,Erythronium,Frost,Phenological synchrony,Pollinator decline,Scopus",,

Warmer winter periods can also affect colony brood rearing activity and consequently the reproduction of the invasive brood parasite Varroa destructor Anderson and Trueman. Until now little is known about the effects of climate change on biotic interactions in such a multitrophic system comprising flowering plants, a pollinator, and its parasite. We performed a reciprocal translocation experiment with honey bee colonies to simulate climate change-induced phenology shifts. Honey bee brood phenology was highly sensitive to environmental conditions in late winter. Colonies in which phenology was experimentally delayed had smaller worker populations in early spring and reduced amounts of stored honey during the following months. During summer, the varroa load in colonies with non-shifted phenology was three times higher than in colonies with delayed phenology. High varroa loads during summer were negatively correlated with worker population growth. Despite a remarkable resilience of colony development to phenology shifts, our results show that mismatches between the phenology of honey bee colonies and flowering plants can affect the build-up of resource stores. Further, an advanced onset of brood rearing activity after hibernation can reinforce the negative impact of the brood parasite V. destructor. We conclude that trade-offs between synchronisation with earlier flower phenology and prolonged brood phases with build-up of varroa populations might constrain the honey bees' capability to adapt to climate warming.","Apis mellifera,Climate change,Phenological mismatch,Scopus,Tri-trophic interactions,Varroa destructor",,

However, long-term multi-season records of past flowering timing have primarily focused on temperate environments. In contrast, changes in flowering phenology within humid subtropical environments such as the southeastern USA remain poorly documented. This research uses herbarium-based methods to examine changes in flowering time across 19,328 samples of spring-, summer-, and autumn-flowering plants in the southeastern USA from the years 1951 to 2009. In this study, species that flower near the onset of the growing season were found to advance under increasing mean March temperatures (−3.391 days/°C, p = 0.022). No long-term advances in early spring flowering or spring temperature were detected during this period, corroborating previous phenological assessments for the southeastern USA. However, late spring through mid-summer flowering exhibited delays in response to higher February temperatures (over 0.1.85 days/°C, p ≤ 0.041 in all cases).

One factor that may influence the pollinator-production relationship across regions is phenology, or the timing of recurring biological events, because crop phenology can be proximately controlled by climatic variables and phenology can affect plant reproductive success. For the economically important crop, coffee (Coffea arabica), at least three aspects of flowering phenology (onset, density and frequency) are influenced by precipitation, which varies across coffee's cultivated range. Of these aspects of flowering phenology, flower density may particularly impact production in coffee because high-density flowering can severely limit outcrossing which is a major contributor to high yields and larger, high quality beans. We studied the C. arabica coffee plant-pollinator interaction over 3 years and across two distinct types of coffee blooms: (1) low-density, synchronous flowering and (2) high-density, synchronous (mass) flowering. Bee species richness was similar for four out of five flowering periods (9.8 ± 2.7 95% CI), but nearly tripled during one high-density flowering period (26 ± 8.6 95% CI). During low-density flowering coffee fruit set rates were varied, but when coffee flowered at high-density, initial fruit set rates remained close to 60% (the rate obtained from manual self-pollination of coffee flowers in pollination experiments). We discuss how changing precipitation patterns may alter coffee flowering phenology and the coffee plant-pollinator relationship, providing insight into how climate change may influence this interaction as well as the resultant coffee production. \textcopyright 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Agroforestry,Bees,Climate,Phenology,Scopus,Shade-coffee",,

Our model outlines how and when changes in the relative phenologies of an interacting species pair will alter the demographic outcome of the interaction. For our plant-pollinator system, we find that plant population growth rates are particularly sensitive to phenology mismatch when flowers are short-lived, when pollinators are short-lived, or when flowers and pollinators exhibit high levels of within-population synchrony in emergence or arrival dates. More generally, our aim is to introduce the use of hybrid dynamical models as a framework through which researchers can directly explore the demographic consequences of climatically driven phenological change. \textcopyright 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Allee effect,Flower senescence,Non-autonomous ordinary differential equation,Phenology,Pollinator emigration,Scopus,Temporal match-mismatch hypothesis,Zonneveld equation",,

Warming in the region in the past century was around 0.5°C, slightly lower than the global average of 0.7°C, while rainfall has remained the same. It is projected that the warming trend will continue for the next two centuries, while precipitation will increase slightly, and soil moisture level will decrease. We identify a number of threats due to climate changes to orchid community in the Yachang Orchid Nature Reserve in Guangxi (hereafter refer to as Yachang Reserve), a good representative of the region. Firstly, decreased soil moisture is likely to have a negative effect on growth and survival of orchids, especially terrestrial and saprophytic ones. Sixty eight (50%) orchid species in the Yachang Reserve are in this category. Secondly, the greater majority of the orchids in Yachang Reserve (72%) have populations on or close to the limestone mountain tops. These populations are likely to shrink or even become extinct as the warming continues because they have no higher places to which they are able to migrate. Natural poleward migration is unlikely for these populations because of the complex terrain, small size of the reserve and human-dominated surroundings. Species with narrow distributions (14%) and/or small population sizes (46%) will be the most vulnerable. In addition, populations represent the southern limit of the species (24%) are also prone to local extinction. Thirdly, extreme rainfall events are projected to occur more frequently, which can exacerbate erosion. This may impact orchid populations that grow on steep cliffs. Fifty seven species (42%) of the orchids in Yachang have cliff populations. Fourthly, the majority of orchid species have specialized insect pollination systems. It is unknown whether the change or lack of change in plant phenology will be in synchrony with the potential phenological shifts of their pollinators. Fifty four (40%) orchid species in Yachang Reserve flower in the spring and are potentially subject to this threat. Finally, mycorrhizal fungi are vital for seed germination for all orchids and important for post-seedling growth for some species. Yet there is a lack of knowledge of the nature of mycorrhiza on all orchids in the region, and little is known on the responses of these vital symbiotic relationships to temperature and soil moisture. Overall, 15% of the orchid species and a quarter of the genera bear high risk of population reduction or local extinction under the current projection of climate change. While studies on predicting and documenting the consequences of climate change on biodiversity are increasing, few identified the actual mechanisms through which climate change will affect individual species. Our study provides a unique perspective by identifying specific threats to a plant community. \textcopyright The New York Botanical Garden 2010.","Biodiversity,Climate Change,Global Change,Nature Reserve,Orchids,Phenology,Plant Conservation,Rare Species,Scopus",,

On eight grasslands we recorded intra-seasonal changes in pollinators, co-flowering plants, weather conditions, flower visitation rates, floral longevity and seed set of Pulsatilla vulgaris. Although bee abundances and the number of pollinator-suitable hours were low at the beginning of the season, early flowers of P. vulgaris received higher flower visitation rates and estimated total number of bee visits than later flowers, which was positively related to seed set. Flower visitation rates decreased over time and with increasing number of co-flowering plants, which competed with P. vulgaris for pollinators. Low interspecific competition for pollinators seems to be a major driver for early flowering dates.

Pollination by insects, an ecosystem service of immense economic and conservation importance [2], depends on synchrony between insect activity and flowering time. If plants and their pollinators show different phenological responses to climate warming, pollination could fail. Information about the effects of warming on specific plant-insect mutualisms is difficult to obtain from complex pollination networks [3]. In contrast, the extraordinarily specific deceptions evolved by orchids [4] that attract a very narrow range of pollinators allow direct examination of the potential for climatic warming to disrupt synchrony. Here we show that a sexually deceptive orchid and the solitary bee on which it depends for pollination will diverge in phenology with increasing spring temperature. Male bees inadvertently pollinate the orchid flowers during pseudocopulation. Analysis of museum specimens (1893-2007) and recent field-based records (1975-2009) showed that flight date of the solitary bee Andrena nigroaenea is advanced more by higher temperatures than is flowering date in the deceptive orchid Ophrys sphegodes. Male bees emerged slightly earlier than females, which attract male copulatory attentions away from the deceptive flowers. Warming by as little as 2°C increased both the probability of male flight and the proportion of females flying in the bee population before orchid flowering; this would reduce the frequency of pseudocopulation and thus lower pollination success rate in the orchid. Our results demonstrate a significant potential for coevolved plant-pollinator relationships to be disrupted by climatic warming.",,,

This spatial variation is critical for determining whether subpopulations and metacommunities are changing in unison or diverging in phenology. Divergent responses could reduce synchrony both within species (disrupting gene flow among subpopulations) and among species (disrupting interspecific interactions in communities). We also lack understanding of phenological change in environments where life history events are frequently aseasonal, such as the tropical, arid, and semi-arid ecosystems that cover vast areas. Using a 33-year-long dataset spanning a 1,267-m semi-arid elevational gradient in the southwestern United States, we test whether flowering phenology diverged among subpopulations within species and among five communities comprising 590 species. Applying circular statistics to test for changes in year-round flowering, we show flowering has become earlier for all communities except at the highest elevations. However, flowering times shifted at different rates across elevations likely because of elevation-specific changes in temperature and precipitation, indicating diverging phenologies of neighboring communities. Subpopulations of individual species also diverged at mid-elevation but converged in phenology at high elevation. These changes in flowering phenology among communities and subpopulations are undetectable when data are pooled across the gradient. Furthermore, we show that nonlinear changes in flowering times over the 33-year record are obscured by traditional calculations of long-term trends. These findings reveal greater spatiotemporal complexity in phenological responses than previously recognized and indicate climate is driving phenological reshuffling across local spatial gradients. Using 33 years of data, Rafferty et al. test whether flowering times have diverged for neighboring communities comprising 590 species across an elevational gradient. Divergent and nonlinear shifts in flowering time are related to elevation-specific changes in temperature and precipitation and will likely alter species interactions and gene flow.","circular statistics,communities,metacommunities,plant-pollinator interactions,plasticity,precipitation,semi-arid ecosystems,subpopulations,temperature",,

However, few studies have compared flowering phenology among life forms within a community and described flowering phenology at the individual, species, and community levels. Methods: We recorded flowering events for individuals of insect-pollinated trees, perennial herbs, and annuals from spring to summer of 2016 and 2017 in a warm-temperate forest in Japan. To compare phenological variables including mean and variance of flowering length, we standardized the number of observed individuals for each species and tested differences in variables, considering the phylogenetic relationships among species. Results: Total flowering length in trees (9–50 d) was significantly shorter than perennial herbs (27–113 d) or annuals (22–89 d), but mean flowering length was not significantly different among them. Flowering length variance was significantly smaller and intraspecies synchrony significantly higher in trees than in perennial herbs and annuals. At the community level, flowering times largely overlapped among successively flowering species, but interspecies synchrony was positive for all life forms. Conclusions: Shorter total flowering length and higher intraspecific synchrony in trees are explained by a modified pollinator attraction hypothesis suggesting that selection favors higher intraspecific synchrony because it promotes between-individual movement of pollinators. At the community level, positive interspecific synchrony for all life forms supports the hypothesis that flowering times tend to converge among species.","interspecific comparison,life form,pollinator attraction,reproductive assurance,resource availability",,

We find many examples of phenological shifts having both positive and negative consequences for vital rates. Yet, few studies link phenological shifts to changes in vital rates known to drive population dynamics, especially in plants. When this link is made, results are largely consistent with life-history theory: Phenological shifts have population-level consequences when they affect survival in longer-lived organisms and reproduction in shorter-lived organisms. However, there are just as many cases in which demographic mechanisms buffer population growth from phenologically induced changes in vital rates. We provide recommendations for future research aiming to understand the complex relationships among climate, phenology, and demography, which will help to elucidate the extent to which phenological shifts actually alter population persistence.","Phenology,phenological mismatch,population growth rate,synchrony,trophic asynchrony,vital rate",,

Its phenology is affected by seasonal variations in temperature, salinity, and precipitation, all of which may be altered by impending climate change. In this work, the monthly leaf, flower, and fruit phenology of R. mangle was assessed at three sites, along a natural salinity gradient for 12 months. We assessed phenological states using litter traps installed in mangrove stands, and by direct observation of leaf production at two sites, and flower, and fruit production at a single site. Phenological events were compared with seasonal climatic variations (in wind, rain, and temperature) to explore potential abiotic controls on the phenology of this species. Leaf shedding was lowest at the low salinity site. Leaf and stipule production showed a seasonal trend, decreasing during the cool and dry winter months. Flowering was highly seasonal and synchronous and peaked during the rainy season. Flowering was correlated with average temperature (r = 0.82; p < 0.05) at all three study sites, but was not correlated with precipitation. At the high-salinity site, flowering was restricted to the rainy season. Fruit abortion was associated with wind speed (r = 0.79; p < 0.05). Flowering of R. mangle is induced by increasing temperatures and the onset of rains. Rising temperatures, drier summers, and more frequent and intense storms, due to climate change, may influence mangrove productivity, population dynamics, and floral synchrony.","Xel-Há,flowering,fruiting,leafing,stipule production,storm intensity,synchrony,timing",,

Shifts in plant phenology can trigger consequences for the plants themselves as well as the communities of consumers that depend upon them. We assembled historical observations of first-flowering dates for 51 species collected in the 1970s and 1980s in a montane sagebrush community in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem and compared these to contemporary phenological observations targeting the same species and locations (2016–2019). We also assembled regional climate data (average spring temperature, day of spring snowmelt, and growing degree days) and tested the relationship between first-flowering time and these variables for each species. We observed the largest change in phenology in early-spring flowers, which, as a group, bloomed on average 17 days earlier, and as much as 36 days earlier, in the contemporary data set. Mid-summer flowers bloomed on average 10 days earlier, nonnative species 15 days earlier, and berry-producing shrubs 5 days earlier, while late summer flowering plants did not shift. The greatest correlates of early-spring and mid-summer flowering were average spring temperature and day of snowmelt, which was 21 days earlier, on average, in 2016–2019 relative to the 1973–1978 observations. The shifts in flowering phenology that we observed could indicate developing asynchronies or novel synchronies of these plant resources and wildlife species of conservation concern, including Greater Sage-grouse, whose nesting success is tied to availability of spring forbs; grizzly bears, which rely heavily on berries for their fall diet; and pollinators. This underscores the importance of maintaining a diverse portfolio of native plants in terms of species composition, genetics, phenological responsiveness to climatic cues, and ecological importance to key wildlife and pollinator species. Redundancy within ecological niches may also be important considering that species roles in the community may shift as climate change affects them differently. These considerations are particularly relevant to restoration and habitat-enhancement projects in sagebrush communities across western North America.","Grand Teton National Park,Greater Sage-grouse,Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem,climate change,community ecology,flowering time,phenological mismatch,phenology,restoration,snowmelt timing,spring temperature",,

Abundance of Bombus species was observed along a fixed transect throughout the flowering season. The number of flowering species was closely related to the floral resources for pollinators at the community scale. In the year with typical weather, the first flowering peak corresponded to the emergence time of queen bees from hibernation, while the second flowering peak corresponded to the active period of worker bees. In the year with an unusually warm spring, however, phenological synchrony between plants and bees was disrupted. Estimated emergence of queen bees was 10 days earlier than the first flowering date owing to earlier soil thawing and warming. However, subsequent worker emergence was delayed, indicating slower colony development. The flowering season finished 2 weeks earlier in the warm-spring year in response to earlier snowmelt. A common resident species in the alpine environment, B. hypocrita sapporoensis, flexibly responded to the yearly fluctuation of flowering. In contrast, population dynamics of other Bombus species were out of synchrony with the flowering: their frequencies were highest at the end of the flowering season in the warm-spring year. Therefore, phenological mismatch between flowers and pollinators is evident during warm years, which may become more prevalent in a warmer climate. To understand the mechanism of phenological mismatch in the pollination system of the alpine ecosystem, ground temperature, snowmelt regime, and life cycle of pollinators are key factors. \textcopyright 2013 The Ecological Society of Japan.","Alpine plants,Bumble bee,Flowering phenology,Phenological mismatch,Temperature",,

Much like spatial community reassembly, temporal reassembly could be particularly important when critical species interactions are temporally concentrated (e.g., plant-pollinator dynamics during flowering). Previous studies have documented species-specific shifts in phenology driven by climate change, implying that temporal reassembly, a process we term “phenological reassembly,” is likely. However, few studies have documented changes in the temporal co-occurrence of community members driven by environmental change, likely because few datasets of entire communities exist. We addressed this gap by quantifying the relationship between flowering phenology and climate for 48 co-occurring subalpine wildflower species at Mount Rainier (Washington, USA) in a large network of plots distributed across Mt. Rainier's steep environmental gradients; large spatio-temporal variability in climate over the 6 yr of our study (including the earliest and latest snowmelt year on record) provided robust estimates of climate-phenology relationships for individual species. We used these relationships to examine changes to community co-flowering composition driven by ‘climate change analog' conditions experienced at our sites in 2015. We found that both the timing and duration of flowering of focal species was strongly sensitive to multiple climatic factors (snowmelt, temperature, and soil moisture). Some consistent responses emerged, including earlier snowmelt and warmer growing seasons driving flowering phenology earlier for all focal species. However, variation among species in their phenological sensitivities to these climate drivers was large enough that phenological reassembly occurred in the climate change analog conditions of 2015. An unexpected driver of phenological reassembly was fine-scale variation in the direction and magnitude of climatic change, causing phenological reassembly to be most apparent early and late in the season and in topographic locations where snow duration was shortest (i.e., at low elevations and on ridges in the landscape). Because phenological reassembly may have implications for many types of ecological interactions, failing to monitor community-level repercussions of species-specific phenological shifts could underestimate climate change impacts.","climate change,community shifts,disassembly,elevation gradient,global change,mutualisms,phenological synchrony",,

Notably, temporal synchrony shapes the patterns of interactions by influencing the probability of encounters between interacting partners; thus, species phenology greatly contributes to structuring ecological communities. In these communities, specialized species are expected to show a high level of synchrony with their partners; however, the relationship between species phenology and specialization remains largely unexplored. In three localities in the tropical mountains of Costa Rica, we quantified the level of phenological synchrony in plant–pollinator networks and tested whether phenological synchrony is associated with the degree of pollinator specialization on plant partners. We also tested the relationship between pollinator specialization and the length of the flowering phase of the visited plants. Across all three studied networks, our results show a strong asynchrony between interacting plant and pollinator species. We also found that more specialized pollinators were more asynchronous with their plant partners and, moreover, that specialized pollinators preferably visited plant species with shorter flowering phases compared to generalized pollinators. These patterns suggest that specialized pollinators may be more vulnerable to mutualistic disruptions because they depend primarily on short-lived resources and have a high risk of phenological mismatch. This discovery has important consequences for specialized species' potential to survive and adapt to changes in the phenology of their interacting partners, which is highly relevant in a time characterized by changing climates and associated shifts in species phenology.","mutualistic interactions,phenological synchrony,pollination,pollinator vulnerability,specialization,temporal asynchrony",,

Yet effects of encroachment on pollination mutualisms are poorly understood. Here, we probe potential fitness impacts of interference from encroaching Salix (willows) on pollination quality of the alpine skypilot, Polemonium viscosum. Overlap in flowering time of Salix and Polemonium is a precondition for interference and was surveyed in four extant and 25 historic contact zones. Pollinator sharing was ascertained from observations of willow pollen on bumble bees visiting Polemonium flowers and on Polemonium pistils. We probed fitness effects of pollinator sharing by measuring the correlation between Salix pollen contamination and seed set in naturally pollinated Polemonium. To ascertain whether Salix interference occurred during or after pollination, we compared seed set under natural pollination, conspecific pollen addition, and Salix pollen addition. In current and past contact zones Polemonium and Salix overlapped in flowering time. After accounting for variance in flowering date due to latitude, Salix and Polemonium showed similar advances in flowering under warmer summers. This trend supports the idea that sensitivity to temperature promotes reproductive synchrony in both species. Salix pollen is carried by bumble bees when visiting Polemonium flowers and accounts for up to 25% of the grains on Polemonium pistils. Salix contamination correlates with reduced seed set in nature and when applied experimentally. Postpollination processes likely mediate these deleterious effects as seed set in nature was not limited by pollen delivery. Synthesis: As willows move higher with climate change, we predict that they will drive postpollination interference, reducing the fitness benefits of pollinator visitation for Polemonium and selecting for traits that reduce pollinator sharing.","Polemonium viscosum,Salix,climate change,heterospecific pollen transfer,plant–climate interactions,reproductive ecology,selection on floral traits,shrub encroachment",,

Higher flowering synchrony yielded greater pollination efficiency, which resulted in 2-fold greater seed set in highly synchronised oaks compared to asynchronous individuals. Pollen addition removed the negative effect of asynchronous flowering on seed set. Because phenological synchrony operates through environmental variation, this result suggests that oak masting is synchronised by exogenous rather than endogenous factors.

The OTCs counteracted the delay in first and peak flowering to some extent. There was no effect of treatment on length of flowering season, although for all variables there were species-specific responses.

Snow melt and degree-days were the best predictors of the end of flowering, whereas degree-days and precipitation best predicted the end of the syrphid period. Flowering advanced at a faster rate than syrphids in response to both advancing snow melt and increasing temperature. Different rates of phenological advancements resulted in more days of temporal overlap between the flower-syrphid community in years of early snow melt because of extended activity periods. Phenological synchrony at the community level is therefore likely to be maintained for some time, even under advancing snow melt conditions that are evident over longer term records at our site. These results show that interacting taxa may respond to different phenological cues and to the same cues at different rates but still maintain phenological synchrony over a range of abiotic conditions. However, our results also indicate that some individual plant species may overlap with the syrphid community for fewer days under continued climate change. This highlights the role of interannual variation in these flower-syrphid interactions and shows that species-level responses can differ from community-level responses in nonintuitive ways. \textcopyright 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Climate change,Hoverfly,Mismatch,Phenology,Pollinator,Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory,Synchrony,Syrphidae",,

For the many species that regenerate through synchronized, quasiperiodic reproductive events termed masting, these changes include decreases in the synchrony and interannual variation in seed production. This breakdown in the occurrence of masting features harms reproduction by decreasing the efficiency of pollination and increasing seed predation. Changes in masting are often paralleled by warming temperatures, but the underlying proximate mechanisms are unknown. We used a unique 39-year study of 139 European beech (Fagus sylvatica) trees that experienced masting breakdown to track the seed developmental cycle and pinpoint phases where weather effects on seed production have changed over time. A cold followed by warm summer led to large coordinated flowering efforts among plants. However, trees failed to respond to the weather signal as summers warmed and the frequency of reproductive cues changed fivefold. Less synchronous flowering resulted in less efficient pollination that further decreased the synchrony of seed maturation. As global temperatures are expected to increase this century, perennial plants that fine-tune their reproductive schedules based on temperature cues may suffer regeneration failures.","mast seeding,phenology,pollen limitation,proximate mechanisms,reproduction,seed production,synchrony,warming",,

Little is known, however, about how climate influences the properties of regional floras, including the rate at which taxa flower sequentially throughout the flowering season. This study is the first to detect geographical variation in this rate across North America. In addition, we tested for the independent effects of intraspecific variation in flowering time and taxonomic composition on the rate of sequential flowering among regional floras distributed across a temperature gradient. Location: North America. Time period: This study examined >59,000 herbarium specimens that were collected in flower from 1901 to 2013. Major taxa studied: 2,803 angiosperm taxa. Methods: We identified 51 climatically homogeneous regions across the continental, mostly western states of the USA, in each of which ≥100 species were represented by herbarium specimens. We then examined the effects of mean annual temperature (MAT) on the rate of sequential flowering among species in each region. We also evaluated whether geographical variation in the rate of sequential flowering was attributable to intraspecific variation in the flowering time and/or the taxonomic composition of regional floras. Results: As MAT increased over space, the rate of sequential flowering (standardized by the absolute length of the flowering season in each region) increased among relatively early-flowering taxa but decreased among the latest-flowering taxa. Both intraspecific variation and shifts in taxonomic composition among floras contributed to this pattern. Main conclusions: Among floras throughout North America, the rate of sequential flowering among co-occurring taxa changes with MAT. Intraspecific phenological variation primarily affects the rate of sequential flowering during the first half of the growing season, consistent with the inference that future warming will most strongly affect flowering synchrony among early-flowering taxa.","climate change,flowering time,herbarium specimen,phenology",,

The high degree of variation in species' phenological shifts has raised concerns about the temporal decoupling of interspecific interactions, but the extent and implications of this effect are largely unknown. In the case of plant-pollinator systems, more specialized species are predicted to be particularly threatened by phenological decoupling, since they are assumed to be less flexible in the choice of interaction partners, but until now this hypothesis has not been tested. In this paper, we studied phenology and interactions of plant and pollinator communities along an altitudinal gradient in the Alps as a model for the possible effects of climate change in time. Our results show that even relatively specialized pollinators were much more flexible in their use of plant species as floral resources than their local flower visitation suggested. We found no relationship between local specialization of pollinators and the consistency of their visitation patterns across sites, and also no relationship between specialization and phenological synchrony of pollinators with particular plants. Thus, in contrast to the conclusions of a recent simulation study, our results suggest that most pollinator species included in this study are not threatened by phenological decoupling from specific flowering plants. However, the flexibility of many rarely observed pollinator species remains unknown. Moreover, our results suggest that specialized flower visitors select plant species based on certain floral traits such as the length of the nectar holder tube. If that is the case, the observed flexibility of plant-pollinator interactions likely depends on a high degree of functional redundancy in the plant community, which may not exist in less diverse systems. \textcopyright 2013 British Ecological Society.","Climate change,Ecological network,Elevation,Flowering,Mutualistic interaction,Phenological decoupling,Phenological mismatch,Phenological shift,Pollination",,

Thus, variation in the shape of display schedules can affect the degree of population synchrony and the strength of phenological assortative mating by flowering onset date. A good understanding of the mechanisms regulating the timing of flowering onset has been developed, but we know less about factors influencing subsequent patterns of floral display. We observed unusual multimodal display schedules in temperate populations of the annual legume Chamaecrista fasciculata. Here, we ask whether 'flowering pulses' are simultaneous among individuals and populations and explore potential underlying mechanisms and consequences of pulsed flowering. We monitored daily flower production for individual plants from genetically divergent populations during a series of field experiments that manipulated three potential influencers of display schedule shape: average daily temperature, pollinator availability and watering schedules. We measured floral longevity to isolate the contributions of flower retention and flower deployment to display schedules. We assessed relationships between flowering and environmental variables and compared estimates of population synchrony, individual synchrony and the strength of assortative mating with those of 29 unimodally flowering species from the area. We observed simultaneous flowering pulses in all experiments, with peaks aligned among individuals and populations despite variation in flowering onset and/or duration. Pulses were not the result of increases in average temperature, pollinator availability or variation in watering schedules. Seasonal fluctuations in temperature correlated with floral longevity and flower deployment, suggesting that the shape of display schedules may be plastic in response to fluctuations in temperature. Average population and individual synchrony differed only slightly from those of the species with unimodal schedules, while the average strength of assortative mating for flowering onset date was strongly reduced (0.21 in C. fasciculata vs. 0.35 for the 29 other species). Synthesis. Researchers should take caution in assuming that components of display schedules are genetically or developmentally correlated with flowering onset. Variation in the shape of display schedules can influence patterns of gene flow within or between populations, with potential effects on the strength of phenological assortative mating and subsequent responses to selection.

Climate change can disrupt this synchrony as phenological responses to climate vary within and across species. However, intra- and interspecific variation in phenological responses is seldom considered simultaneously, limiting our understanding of climate change impacts on interactions among taxa across their ranges. We investigated how variation in phenological sensitivity to climate can alter ecological interactions simultaneously within and among species using natural history collections and citizen science data. We focus on a unique system, comprising a wide-ranged spring ephemeral with varying color morphs (Claytonia virginica) and its specialist bee pollinator (Andrena erigeniae). We found strongly opposing trends in the phenological sensitivities of plants vs their pollinators. Flowering phenology was more sensitive to temperature in warmer regions, whereas bee phenology was more responsive in colder regions. Phenological sensitivity varied across flower color morphs. Temporal synchrony between flowering and pollinator activity was predicted to change heterogeneously across the species' ranges in the future. Our work demonstrates the complexity and fragility of ecological interactions in time and the necessity of incorporating variation in phenological responses across multiple axes to understand how such interactions will change in the future.","Virginia spring beauty,ecoregion,flowering,occurrence,phenological mismatch,spring beauty miner bee",,

Such shifts in the phenologies of interacting species may lead to shifts in their synchrony, with cascading community and ecosystem consequences. To date, single-system studies have provided no clear picture, either finding synchrony shifts may be extremely prevalent [Mayor SJ, et al. (2017) Sci Rep 7:1902] or relatively uncommon [Iler AM, et al. (2013) Glob Chang Biol 19:2348–2359], suggesting that shifts toward asynchrony may be infrequent. A meta-analytic approach would provide insights into global trends and how they are linked to climate change. We compared phenological shifts among pairwise species interactions (e.g., predator–prey) using published long-term time-series data of phenological events from aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems across four continents since 1951 to determine whether recent climate change has led to overall shifts in synchrony. We show that the relative timing of key life cycle events of interacting species has changed significantly over the past 35 years. Further, by comparing the period before major climate change (pre-1980s) and after, we show that estimated changes in phenology and synchrony are greater in recent decades. However, there has been no consistent trend in the direction of these changes. Our findings show that there have been shifts in the timing of interacting species in recent decades; the next challenges are to improve our ability to predict the direction of change and understand the full consequences for communities and ecosystems.","Baseline,Global warming,Mismatch,Time series,Trophic interactions",,

However, there are few studies that have examined a range of unrelated taxa in alpine environments to determine whether there is commonality in the proximate causes, synchrony in timing, or the direction of any changes. Records for five alpine animal species and two alpine plant species, chosen primarily for their visibility, were examined to determine their temporal response to regional climate warming. Over the 30-year period studied, they showed an array of different phenological responses. Plant flowering appeared linked to date of snow melt, whereas animal responses varied. Although having accelerated phenologies, two migratory bird species exhibited contrary changes; one to low-altitude warming regardless of snow conditions in the alpine zone (flame robin) and the other to state of the snowpack regardless of low-altitude temperatures (Richard's pipit). By contrast, the migratory bogong moth arrived significantly later over the years with no apparent explanatory climatic cause. Although bogong moths are not responding to earlier snow melt, insectivorous predators on the ground are. This could lead to a serious mismatch in timing at different trophic levels, putting pressure on endangered vertebrates. Emergence of locally wintering insect species, March flies and Macleay's swallowtails, were not significantly related to measured climatic parameters over the study period. A consequence of the disparate responses to climate warming recorded here is the questionable value of 'indicator species' to examine the impact of climate warming on alpine ecosystems. \textcopyright 2010 Science Press, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Bogong moth,Climate change,Migration,Mismatch,Phenology",,
